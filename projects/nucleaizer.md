## Purpose

> Describe the problem you are trying to solve by packaging your tool as a napari plugin in 1-2 sentences.
I should be able to read this alone and communicate the value to someone else.

### Why does this matter to biologists?

### Why does this matter to you and your professional goals and responsibilities?

## Goals
> What would you like to accomplish during the Alfa Cohort collaboration?

1. Offer out-of-the-box pre-trained model (one of 5-10) for users to apply to their own data
2. [stretch] Enable users to train on their own data
  - from scratch
  - initialized with pre-trained data (primary canonical dataset & 5-10 pre-trained)


## Scope

### Key Flows

> Show what the end-to-end experience will be for biologists.

[nucleaizer.org workflow, akin to “detect primary objects” in cellprofiler]

A biologist will be able to
1. Load their own data into napari
2. Select a nucleAIzer model
3. Set cell size
4. Apply the model
5. View labelled objects
6. Save or merge with other data for further analysis

[training] A biologist will be able to
1. Load their own data into napari
2. Annotate their data
3. [optional] select an initialization model
4. Start training
5. View labelled objects
6. [optional] Save or share the newly trained model
7. [upper workflow]
